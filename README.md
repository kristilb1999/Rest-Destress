# Rest-Destress
A website project aimed toward emerging adults to improve mental wellness.

This website was created as part of my thesis project during the Fall 2020-Spring 2021 school semesters at Siena College.

This project is exploring the importance of using technology and AI in psychology to promote better mental wellness.
