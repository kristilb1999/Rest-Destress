            <h3 id="title">Pursed Lip Breathing</h3>
            <section id="article">
            <p>According to the <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9443-pursed-lip-breathing" title="Cleavland Clinic" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a>, pursed lip breathing has a range of benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It’s been shown to reduce how hard you have to work to breathe.</li>
                <li>It helps release air trapped in the lungs.</li>
                <li>It promotes relaxation.</li>
                <li>It reduces shortness of breath.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Practicing this technique 4 to 5 times daily can help. Here’s how to practice pursed lip breathing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>While keeping your mouth closed, take a deep breath in through your nose, counting to 2. Follow this pattern by repeating in your head “inhale, 1, 2.” <br> The breath doesn’t have to be deep. A typical inhale will do.</li>
                <li>Put your lips together as if you’re starting to whistle or blow out candles on a birthday cake. This is known as “pursing” your lips.</li>
                <li>While continuing to keep your lips pursed, slowly breathe out by counting to 4. Don’t try to force the air out, but instead breathe out slowly through your mouth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Exercise tip:</strong> Pursed lip breathing is best for performing strenuous activities, such as climbing stairs.</p>
